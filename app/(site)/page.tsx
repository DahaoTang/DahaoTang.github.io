				Key Modifications: Ref Usage: A React ref (dropdownRef) is attached to
				the dropdown menu's outer div element. This ref helps in determining if
				the click was inside the dropdown element. Effect for Click Listener:
				The useEffect hook sets up an event listener on the document for
				"mousedown" events. The listener checks if the click is outside the
				dropdown (using the ref) and closes the dropdown if so. Cleanup: It's
				important to remove the event listener when the component unmounts to
				avoid memory leaks and other side effects. Integration in a Header: The
				DropdownMenu is designed to be part of a header or any other component,
				and its usage remains as previously described. This change does not
				affect how you include it in the header or page but improves its
				interaction behavior. This implementation ensures that the dropdown menu
				closes when the user interacts with other parts of the application,
				providing a clean and expected behavior for dropdown menus. If you need
				further customization or face any issues, feel free to ask! blur the
				current page in the background when the dropdown menu is opened. Blur
				the entire screen but the trigger and the items. ChatGPT To achieve a
				visual effect where the rest of the page blurs when the dropdown menu is
				opened, you can use CSS to manipulate the backdrop filter on the rest of
				the page elements, excluding the dropdown menu and its trigger. This can
				be accomplished using conditional class application in React, which
				adjusts the styling of the page based on the state of the dropdown menu.
